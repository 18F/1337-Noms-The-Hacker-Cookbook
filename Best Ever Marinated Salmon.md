# Best Ever Marinated Salmon Fillet

## Ingredients

- whole salmon fillet (whatever size you want)
- 1/2 cup soy sauce (something good like Shoyu)
- 3-4 green onions cut into 1 inch pieces
- dash or 2 of sesame oil
- 4 slices ginger root
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 T lime juice (more if you like)
- 1/2 cup water

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients excpet salmon in a medium size sauce pan, heat to simmer and stir to combine.
2. Place salmon in an ovenproof baking dish and pour hot marinade over fish, turning after 10 minutes.
3. Marinate salmon for at least 1 hour, turning several times.
4. Pre-heat oven to 350Â° and bake uncovered for 10-12 min each side or until center of fish has turned from deep translucent pink to opaque pale pink.  Cooking time will vary with thickness of fillet.
5. Serve hot, warm or cold over rice, grain or greens.  It's good every way!
6. This is a very forgiving recipe so experiment with proportions as you like, just remember that the marinade should start out saltier and sharper tasting than the final sauce after cooking the salmon.

Enjoy!
