# This recipe takes a good old Southern Mashed Potato recipe, makes it "loaded", and
# then creates crispy, fried croqettes from them. It takes a bit of time, mostly due
# to the croquettes need to be frozen a couple of times.

Ingredients:

About 3-4 lbs of golden potatos
4 Tbl salted butter
8 oz of sour cream
1 cup of milk
8 oz block of cheddar (shredded - I prefer Tillamook)
1/2 cup chopped fresh chives (add more to taste)
1/2 Tbl liquid smoke (to flavor)
Bread crumbs or crackers (or both!)
6 Large eggs
Salt and black pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste
