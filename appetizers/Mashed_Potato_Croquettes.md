# This recipe takes a good old Southern Mashed Potato recipe, makes it "loaded", and
# then creates crispy, fried croqettes from them. It takes a bit of time, mostly due
# to the croquettes need to be frozen a couple of times.
#
# These croquettes are soft, fluffy, and rich flavored on the insides, and crispy on 
# the outside. When they're steaming hot, they're a perfect comfort food for hackers.
# Try them with a dip, for added punch. Mayo/Sriracha combination, honey mustard, or
# even ranch dressing are good options.

# Ingredients:

About 3-4 lbs of golden potatos
4 Tbl salted butter
8 oz of sour cream
1 cup of milk
About a cup of finely diced, fresh chives
8 oz block of cheddar (shredded - I prefer Tillamook)
1/2 cup chopped fresh chives (add more to taste)
1/2 Tbl liquid smoke (to flavor)
Bread crumbs or crackers (or both!)
6 Large eggs
Salt and black pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste

Fryer with appropriate oil, heated to 350 degrees F, when needed.

# Making the potatoes
Wash and peel the potatoes. Dice them all into 1 inch squares or less. Rinse the potatoes briefly.
Place the potatoes in a large pot of water, and bring to a boil. You can add salt if you, but I 
tend to add the salt to the mashed potatoes, once they're prepared. Boil the potatoes until tender.

While the potatoes are cooking, finely dice the chives, and set aside for next step. Also grate the
cheese, and set aside.

Strain the cooked potatoes, and then put back in the pot. Mash the potatoes

Add garlic powder, salt, butter, sourcream,
cheese, chives, black pepper, and liquid smok
