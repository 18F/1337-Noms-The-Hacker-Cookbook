# Tea Tasting Cup
Make loose leaf tea without a fancy teacup or teapot!


## Supplies
* Soda can
* Sharp pokey thing
* Can opener

## Instructions
1. Drain all liquid from the soda can
2. Remove the lid of the soda can using the can opener
3. Poke many holes in the soda can with regular spacing using your sharp pokey thing

## Tips n' Tricks!
* If you aren't make sure to have proper adult supervision before doing this.
* Poke holes with discretion. Don't stab yourself.
* Don't be afraid to take the can opener off the can a few times while removing the lid. You'll probably get a cleaner cut if you do many small twists and reposition the can opener more often.
