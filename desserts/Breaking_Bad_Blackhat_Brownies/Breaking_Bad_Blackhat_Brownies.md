Breaking Bad BlackHat Brownies


A nice pick-me-up mocha-ish treat. Versatile. I suggest using the strongest most wicked coffee you can. I use Death Wish Coffee, at twice the caffeine, but for taste, you may want to use whatever brand you prefer tastes better. 

Ingredients for Brownies: 

½ Pound Butter Melted (choice of butter here is optional salted/unsalted) Also please check and abide by State Laws if adding any “alternative” butter. 

4 Tablespoons Dark Cocoa

1 Cup Water

2 Cups Flour

2 Cups Sugar

1 Teaspoon Baking Soda

½ Teaspoon Salt

½ Cup Buttermilk

2 Eggs 

1 Teaspoon Vanilla

2-4 Shots Espresso (as thick as possible, or just add less water if over 4 shots)

Frosting:

¼ Pound Butter (again, what butter you use is at your discretion)

4 Tablespoons Dark Cocoa 

8 Tablespoons Buttermilk

1 Teaspoon Vanilla

1 Box Confectioners Sugar

Optional = 1 Cup chopped Nuts of your choice (be mindful of those with nut allergies)


Cooking the Brownies:
Preheat Oven to 350 Degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius)

Add Cocoa & Water to Butter. 

Add Espresso shots and bring to a boil.  

Mix together Flour, Sugar, Soda & Salt.

Add boiling Cocoa mixture & stir until blended.

Add Buttermilk, Eggs & Vanilla. Stir Until smooth.

Pour into a greased baking pan of suitable shape. 


Making the Frosting:

Add Cocoa & Buttermilk to Butter and bring to a boil in a medium sauce pan.

Add Sugar & Vanilla, stirring until smooth consistency. 

Pour over the warmed cooked brownies. Optionally adding chopped Nuts. 


Enjoy.
